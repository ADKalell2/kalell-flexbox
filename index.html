                <h1>Fun Tip</h1>
                <p>The game's epic story is based on Commander Yeager of the United Galaxy Space Force who jumps through dimensions to face the recurring threat of the Galaga forces so as to protect and bring peace back to space. The story, game stages and enemy forces have evolved, making the game a true successor to the series.</p>

                <h1>About Galaga</h1>
                <img src= "images/Galaga(7).jpg" alt="Galaga(7)">
                <p>Galaga is a fixed shooter. The player mans a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the Galaga forces from destroying all of mankind. The objective of each stage is to defeat all of the Galaga aliens, which will fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen. Similar to Galaxian, aliens will dive towards the player while shooting down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens will result in a life being lost.</p>
                <p>Atop the enemy formation are four large aliens known as the "Boss Galaga", which take two shots to destroy. These aliens can use a tractor beam to capture the player's ship, returning with it to the top of the formation and costing the player a life. Should additional lives remain, the player has an opportunity to shoot down the Boss Galaga holding the captured ship. Shooting it down as it dives towards the player will result in the captured ship being rescued, and it will join the player's ship, transforming it into a "dual-fighter" with additional firepower and a larger hitbox. However, destroying a Boss Galaga with a captured ship while it is in formation will instead cause the fighter to turn against the player and act as an alien. The ship will return in a later level as part of the formation.</p>
                <p>Some enemies can morph into new enemy types with different attack patterns, with one even taking the form of the Galaxian Flagship. Stages are indicated by emblems located at the bottom-right of the screen. Enemies become more aggressive as the game progresses, increasing their number of projectiles and diving down at a faster rate. The third stage and every fourth thereafter is a bonus stage, where the aliens fly in a preset formation without firing at the player.</p>

                <h1>Galaga Facts</h1>
                <li>1981’s Galaga is a sequel to the mega hit Galaxian.</li>
                <li>In 2013 a bunch of kids made a movie called Project: Galaga or Galaga Project.</li>
                <li>To get to the top of Galaga mountain you have to have the stamina of a racehorse, the hand/eye coordination of a brain surgeon and a bladder big enough to ensure you don’t go to the bathroom for an entire day.</li>
                <li>One way to rack up a lot of points is by exploiting this bug found in the game. One the first level, kill everything except the two bees in the lower left of the play field.</li>
